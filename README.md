# Simple-GUI
A simple GUI for entering data that gets stored in an excel file. Comes with an .exe file

The base template for the UI is created using Python and SimpleGUI (see Example.png for a photo of the UI).
The python file is converted into a .exe file for ease of use.
Upon loading the exe file, the UI allows the user to input data and submit, which is stored in the accompanying excel file.

NOTE: renaming any of the files will require the python file to be adjusted and the .exe recreated
NOTE: keep the .exe and .xlsx in the same directory, otherwises the python file will need to be adjusted
